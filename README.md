# Extended Vanilla Experience
Extended Vanilla Experience was a EUIV *general overhaul mod* that aimed to deliver an enhanced game experience without 
destroying the look, feel or performance of the base game. Its continual development ended on 21 Oct, 2016 (*version v1.18.x*).

This will be an attempt at remaking this mod with the same vision in mind, employing different ideas to achieve it.

You can find the original mod on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196181867) and [Paradoxwikis](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Extended_Vanilla_Experience).
