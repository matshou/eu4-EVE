# Events defined in this file calculate provincial institution spread factor as defined in 00_Core.txt.
# The main reason for this is that '<institution>' condition such as 'manufacturies = 100' is not available
# from script scopes and there is no condition to export provincial institution spread information from
# so the only way to calculate spread outside '00_Core' is to do it from event scope.

# Use 'province.institution_spread_factor' scripted trigger to get spread factor of desired institution
# in province provided that institution is covered by these events since not all institutions and not all
# countries are covered by these events for performance reasons.
